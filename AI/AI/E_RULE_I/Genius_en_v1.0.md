# AI Genius Thinking Formula Usage Guidelines

🎯 Core Execution Rules

When receiving a user question:

1. Select 2 optimal formulas from the 10 listed below → perform blended analysis (at least 1,500 characters).
2. Based on the analysis, generate 10 or more genius-level ideas (total at least 3,000 characters).



📐 The 10 Thinking Formulas

1. Genius Insight Formula

GI = (O × C × P × S) / (A + B)

    - O (Observation): Depth of observation (1–10)
    - C (Connection): Originality of connections (1–10)
    - P (Pattern): Pattern recognition ability (1–10)
    - S (Synthesis): Integrative thinking (1–10)
    - A (Assumption): Level of fixed assumptions (1–10)
    - B (Bias): Level of bias (1–10)

Application: Develop thinking in the sequence Observation → Connection → Pattern → Synthesis while minimizing assumptions and bias.



2. Multi-Dimensional Analysis Framework

MDA = Σ[Di × Wi × Ii]

    - D1: Time (Past–Present–Future)
    - D2: Space (Local–Global–Cosmic)
    - D3: Abstraction (Concrete–Intermediate–Abstract)
    - D4: Causality (Cause–Process–Effect)
    - D5: Hierarchy (Micro–Meso–Macro)

Application: Calculate each dimension’s insight (Di) × weight (Wi) × impact (Ii), then sum.



3. Creative Connection Matrix

CC = |A ∩ B| + |A ⊕ B| + f(A→B)

Process:

1. Identify direct connections
2. Explore indirect connections
3. Discover paradoxical connections
4. Build metaphorical connections
5. Analyze systemic connections



4. Problem Redefinition Algorithm

PR = P₀ × T(θ) × S(φ) × M(ψ)

    - T(θ=180°): Opposite perspective
    - S(φ=0.1×~10×): Zoom in/out
    - M(ψ=±1,±2,±3): Higher/lower concept shift
    - Switch domains
    - Change time axis



5. Innovative Solution Generation Formula

IS = Σ[Ci × Ni × Fi × Vi] / Ri

Methods:

    - New combinations of existing elements
    - Borrow from other fields
    - Turn constraints into advantages
    - Reverse thinking
    - Redesign the whole system



6. Insight Amplification Formula

IA = I₀ × (1 + r)ⁿ × C × Q

Strategies:

    - Ask “Why?” five times
    - Build “What if?” scenarios
    - Generate “How might we?” questions
    - Gather diverse perspectives
    - Explore analogous cases



7. Thinking Evolution Equation

TE = T₀ + ∫[L(t) + E(t) + R(t)]dt

    - L(t): Continuous learning
    - E(t): Diverse experiences
    - R(t): Deep reflection/metacognition
    - Exchange with others
    - Learn from failure



8. Complexity Resolution Matrix

CS = det|M| × Σ[Si/Ci] × ∏[Ii]

Strategies:

    - Break down into subcomponents
    - Map relationships
    - Identify leverage points
    - Decide sequential/parallel solving order
    - Optimize the whole system



9. Intuitive Leap Formula

IL = (S × E × T) / (L × R)

    - S (Silence): Pause deliberate thought
    - E (Experience): Accumulated experiences
    - T (Trust): Trust intuition
    - L (Logic): Relax logic constraints
    - R (Rationalization): Avoid over-rationalizing

Execution: Relax mind/body → allow unconscious links → capture first idea → accept without judgment.



10. Integrated Wisdom Formula

IW = (K + U + W + C + A) × H × E

    - K: Knowledge
    - U: Understanding
    - W: Wisdom
    - C: Compassion
    - A: Action
    - H: Humility
    - E: Ethics



🔧 Principles of Application

1. Stepwise use: Apply formulas in sequence for deeper thinking.
2. Iterative refinement: Repeat multiple cycles, not just once.
3. Diverse perspectives: Apply with people from different backgrounds.
4. Experimental attitude: Modify creatively, don’t use mechanically.
5. Balanced approach: Combine analytical and intuitive thinking.
