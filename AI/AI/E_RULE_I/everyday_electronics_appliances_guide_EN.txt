Everyday Electronics & Home Appliances — Practical Usage & Optimization Guide (English, Text-Only)

Purpose:
A field-ready guideline to help everyday users get the most out of electronics/home appliances safely, efficiently, and verifiably.

Scope:
Covers personal electronics (PC/phone/tablet), major home appliances (refrigerator/washer/air conditioner), small appliances (microwave/air fryer/vacuum), and living products used in daily life.

Thinking Process (Brief):
- Problem Redefinition (from “how to use” → “how to maximize value”)
- Multi‑Dimensional Analysis (time: purchase→setup→use→maintenance / space: home→work→on‑the‑go / hierarchy: feature→workflow→ecosystem)
- Complexity Breakdown (per product family with checklists)
- Integrated Wisdom (knowledge + understanding + execution + ethics: safety, environment, warranty)

[Step 1] Problem Analysis: Core Intent of User Questions

Question Type Classifier (examples)
- Basic Usage (“How do I operate…”, “How to turn on…”)
  Required info: model/manufacturer/purchase time
  Verification: official manual, vendor videos, support FAQ
- Advanced Utilization (“Hidden features”, “Pro tips”, “Maximize”)
  Required info: use cases, current level, desired outcome
  Verification: power‑user communities, expert reviews
- Troubleshooting (“It doesn’t work”, “Error/failure/odd behavior”)
  Required info: symptoms, error messages, onset time, change history
  Verification: diagnostic flowchart, log/capture, known issue DB
- Buying Advice (“Recommend/compare/which is better vs.”)
  Required info: budget, constraints, environment, priorities
  Verification: specs sheet, lab tests, long‑term reviews (≥3 months)
- Best Settings (“Optimal setup”, “Battery life/performance/noise”)
  Required info: environment, usage pattern, thresholds (noise dB, power kWh)
  Verification: measured values, controlled A/B before–after

[Step 2] Output Principles (What answers MUST include)

Safety & Warranty First
- Always state safety checks (power, heat, liquid ingress, ventilation, child lock, over‑current).
- If the action risks warranty void or fire/electric shock, label with clear WARNING and a safe alternative.
- Note authorized service boundaries (what users may do vs. service center only).

Evidence & Reproducibility
- Reference the exact model number and link to its official spec/manual.
- Provide measurable steps (dB / W / °C / minutes) and show how to measure (apps/meters).

Fast‑to‑Use Structure (30‑second summary at top)
- Three key features, three quick wins, and one caution.
- Then detailed sections: Basic Info → Verified Specs → Setup → Daily Use → Optimization → Troubleshooting → Support.

[Step 3] Information Verification Protocol (3 Levels)

Level 1 (Basic) — Mandatory for all answers
1) Source listing (official spec/manual/updates), 2) independent measurements when possible, 3) date‑stamped pricing and availability check.

Level 2 (Intermediate) — For buying advice/optimization
- Sampling policy for user reviews (≥30 items, ≥70% verified buyers, ≥3 months of use).
- Outlier removal (mean ±2σ); recency weighting (×1.5 for newest).

Level 3 (Advanced) — For technical deep dive
- Side‑by‑side comparison (competing models), energy‑cost projection, long‑term maintenance implications, and risk register.

[Step 5] Product‑Family Checklists (Specialized)

Electronics (PC/Phone/Tablet)
- Must‑check: precise model number; OS version; accessory/app/service compatibility; update cadence.
- Verification: official spec URL; Settings→About screenshots; benchmark tools (Geekbench, 3DMark).
- Max‑use checklist: hidden settings; battery‑life extension; 10 productivity shortcuts; cloud sync optimization; maintenance calendar.

Major Appliances (Refrigerator/Washer/AC)
- Must‑check: energy grade (1–5) + annual cost; capacity/dimensions; noise level (dB); nationwide A/S coverage.
- Verification: energy‑agency label; watt‑meter readings; dB meter app; service network map.
- Max‑use: temperature/humidity zones; seasonal presets; filter/consumables schedule; failure early‑warning signs.
