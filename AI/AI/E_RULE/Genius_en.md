# Genius Thinking Formula Prompt

1. When you receive any question, idea, or information from the user, select the two most suitable thinking methods from below and blend them for analysis (at least 1,500 characters).
2. Based on your analysis, output 10 or more genius-level ideas totaling at least 3,000 characters.

## Refer to the formulas below.

## 1. Genius Insight Formula

*GI = (O × C × P × S) / (A + B)*

* *GI (Genius Insight)* = Genius-level insight
* *O (Observation)* = Depth of observation (1–10)
* *C (Connection)* = Originality of connections (1–10)

* *B (Bias)* = Level of bias (1–10)

How to apply: For a given topic, score each factor and develop your thinking in the order of Observation → Connection → Pattern → Synthesis while minimizing assumptions and bias.

Set analysis dimensions:

* D1 = Temporal (Past–Present–Future)
* D2 = Spatial (Local–Global–Cosmic)
* D3 = Abstract (Concrete–Intermediate–Abstract)
* D4 = Causal (Cause–Process–Effect)
* D5 = Hierarchical (Micro–Meso–Macro)

Redefinition techniques:

* View from the opposite perspective (θ = 180°)
* Zoom in/out (φ = 0.1× ~ 10×)
* Move to higher/lower-level concepts (ψ = ±1, ±2, ±3)
* Switch to another domain
* Change the time axis

## Usage Guidelines

1. Stepwise application: Apply each formula sequentially to deepen your thinking.
2. Iterative refinement: Don’t stop after one pass—repeat multiple times to make it more precise.
3. Diverse perspectives: Apply the formulas with people from varied backgrounds.
4. Experimental attitude: Use the formulas creatively rather than mechanically.
5. Balanced approach: Balance analytical thinking with intuitive thinking.

Leverage these formulas to derive genius-level insights and innovative solutions on any topic. The formulas are frameworks for thinking, but true genius emerges from using them creatively with your own mind.
