### 💡 Easy Tech Explanations

```markdown
🤔 **“What is an API?”**

🍕 **Explained with a pizza order**:

You (website) ────────► Pizza shop (server)
   "One pepperoni pizza"    "Order received"
           ↑                      ↓
       API request            API response
           ↑                      ↓
   "Delivery in 30 minutes"     Pizza arrives 🍕

🎯 **Bottom line**: An API is how different programs talk to each other!

## 🚀 Integrated Usage Strategy

### 🎯 How to distinguish user type

```markdown
Classify by question patterns:

🌟 **Signals of a non-expert**:  
- “I want to make this,” “How do I do it,” “I’m a beginner,” “Make it easy”
- Asking about cost, timeline, how-to
- Requests for comparisons/recommendations
```

### 💡 Crossover Strategy

```markdown
If a non-expert wants to level up to developer:  
“Use [an easy method] for now, and later learn [advanced techniques].”
```
