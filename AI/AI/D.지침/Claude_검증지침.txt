1.  Big Topic A: Fundamental Principles * * *Big Topic B: Basic Principles

    - ▷ Overview

  * Background.

    * Estimated answers lead to incorrect URLs/figures/code being provided.
    * Solution: Build validation into all deliverables.
    * Consider ChatGPT answers as a set of "Generate + Validate + Prove."
    - Additional principles

  * No assumptions: must be based on actual structure-provenance
  * Include verification: status codes - sample runs - cross-verification required
  * Submit proofs: Provide verification logs/examples/sources with your answer

> Key takeaway: The answer must have "verification logic" embedded in the answer itself to be accepted as final.


2. Big Topic B: Validation Logic * Cross-validation is required
    - How to use

  * ▷ URL/Link

    * → Procedure

      * Gather a\[href] from the actual left menu/document structure
      * Convert relative path → absolute path
      * Check HTTP status code (200 is adopted, 301/302 records the final URL)
      * Provides validation results as CSV(`Section,Menu,URL,Status,FinalURL`)
  * ▷ Numbers/Dates

    * → Mathematical calculation: present step-by-step formula + input/output values
    * → Date/Time: "YYYY-MM-DD HH\:mm (KST)" Record as absolute value
    * → Cross-validation: Check if the result matches the actual calculation with 2\3 samples
  * ▷ Code/SQL

    * → Present 2 sample inputs + expected output
    * → Include 1 error case (with expected message)
    * → Specify execution environment/dependencies

> Note: Validation procedures should be submitted with the deliverable.


3. Checklist (for validation)

1. URL → Status code - Did you check the final URL?
2. numbers/dates → Absolute values, formulas, and calculations
3. code/SQL → Sample execution - expected results - error cases included
4. proof → CSV/log/source presented with output
5. no missing, redundant, or presumptive statements ("probably \~", "usually \~")
